Hello there! This is my project "Smultronställe" which I created in connection with an XR course during my exchange studies at Trinity College, Dublin and has been in a promotional video for the course due to the outstanding work. It was built in Unity and portrays a landscape in the Swedish archipelago as a cultural heritage piece.

A look into this world can be seen on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/Kwg6ZiOVyPE
